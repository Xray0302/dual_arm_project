CMake Error at /home/xurui/double_robot_project/devel/share/wrp_sdk/cmake/wrp_sdkConfig.cmake:173 (message):
  Project 'tracer_base' tried to find library 'wrp_sdk'.  The library is
  neither a target nor built/installed properly.  Did you compile project
  'wrp_sdk'? Did you find_package() it before the subdirectory containing its
  code is included?
Call Stack (most recent call first):
