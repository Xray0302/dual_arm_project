CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "aubo_msgs" with
  any of the following names:

  Add the installation prefix of "aubo_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "aubo_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "aubo_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
